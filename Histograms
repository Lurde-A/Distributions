                                        SUMMARIZING YOUR DATA
  1. The script.py file imports a data frame. Before you start making a histogram, it’s important to understand the shape of your data. Use the following code to print your data:
print(transactions). Run your code. Scroll to the top of the output panel to see the column names, and values in the columns. Can you identify some maximums and minimums in each column?
//
print(transactions)                                  RESULT:               Transaction Time        Cost
                                                              0            7.939419                98.422021
                                                              1            4.314811                87.329861
                                                              2            6.394080                112.334882
                                                              3            7.031504                87.570689
                                                              4            5.840730                97.321191
                                                              ..                ...                     ...
                                                              995          18.728278               34.802198
                                                              996          18.183858               36.349422
                                                              997          16.803236               59.230032
                                                              998          19.680992               23.748946
                                                              999          23.369355               57.442948
   2. Use the following code to find the average time that a person arrives at the grocery store: print(np.average(times)). The Transaction Time column contains numbers between 0 and 
<24. The number 0 is 12:00am. You can think of <24 as just before midnight the next day, or 11:59pm. You should find that the average time is 14.9, which is close to 3pm. We calculated 
this by subtracting 12 from 14.9, which is close to 3pm. This doesn’t make much sense to the manager, because they know their busiest times of the day are after 6pm, as many customers 
stop by on their way home from work.
//
print(np.average(times))                             RESULT:  14.943439668312365

                                        RANGE
  3. Find the minimum transaction time and save it to min_time.
//
min_time = np.amin(times)                            RESULT: Earliest Time: 0.02661518360957871
  4. Find the maximum transaction time and save it to max_time.
//
max_time = np.amax(times)                            RESULT: Latest Time: 23.675374635328755
  5. Find the range, and save it to range_time.
//
range_time = max_time - min_time                     RESULT: Time Range: 23.648759451719176

                                        BINS AND COUNT I
  6. In script.py, there is an array called days_old_bread that contains values for the age of different loaves of bread in the grocery store. Find the minimum value of the array and 
save it to min_days_old.
//
min_days_old = np.amin(days_old_bread)
  7. Find the maximum value of the array and save it to max_days_old.
//
max_days_old = np.amax(days_old_bread)
  8. Set the variable bins equal to 3. When you run the code, it will output the number of bins for this histogram, and the width of these bins. In the next exercise, we’ll figure out 
which values fall into each bin. At the bottom of script.py, we calculate the bin width by subtracting min_days_old from max_days_old, adding one, then dividing by three. We must add 
one because there are nine possible answers from zero to eight.
//
bins=3                                                RESULT: Bins: 3
                                                              Bin Width: 3.0

                                        BINS AND COUNT II
GIVEN:
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
# Array of days old bread
days_old_bread = np.array([0, 8, 7, 8, 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 2])
# Count the values in each bin 
days_old_012 = 0
days_old_345 = 0
days_old_678 = 0
# Printing the values
print("Between 0 and 2 days: " + str(days_old_012))
print("Between 3 and 5 days: " + str(days_old_345))
print("Between 6 and 8 days: " + str(days_old_678))
  9. The store manager checks the age of all loaves on the shelves every three days, with the freshest loaves displayed on the most obvious shelf, and the oldest loaves being thrown 
out. Because of this pattern, the store manager wants to know the number of loaves in each of three different bins. Count the number of loaves that have values of 0, 1, or 2, and save 
it to days_old_012.
//
Calculating                                            RESULT: "Between 0 and 2 days: 4"
days_old_012 = 4
  10. Count the number of loaves that have values of 3, 4, or 5, and save it to days_old_345.
//
Calculating                                            RESULT: "Between 3 and 5 days: 2"
days_old_345 = 2
  11. Count the number of loaves that have values of 6, 7, or 8, and save it to days_old_678.
//
Calculating                                            RESULT: "Between 6 and 8 days: 4"
days_old_678 = 4

                                        HISTOGRAMS
GIVEN:
# Import packages
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
# Read in transactions data
transactions = pd.read_csv("transactions.csv")
# Save transaction times to a separate numpy array
times = transactions["Transaction Time"].values
# Use numpy.histogram() below
times_hist = 0
print(times_hist)
  12. Use the np.histogram() function to determine the busiest six hours of the day. Save the result to times_hist on line 12. Use the following range and number of bins.
Range: 0 to 24, Bins: 4. Can you determine which six-hour period is the busiest? Check the hint if you need help, or want to see the correct answer.
//
times_hist = np.histogram(times, range = (0, 24), bins = 4)
print(times_hist)                                      RESULT: (array([101, 231, 213, 455]), array([ 0.,  6., 12., 18., 24.]))

                                        PLOTTING A HISTOGRAM
  13. At the top of script.py, we’ve imported codecademylib3, which is a package that Codecademy uses to plot your histogram in the panel to the right. Don’t worry about this library. 
Any Python development environment that you may use will take care of this for you. From matplotlib, import pyplot as plt.
//
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  14. Use the plt.hist() function to create a plot for each six-hour period in a day. Use the following range and number of bins. Range: 0 to 24, Bins: 4.
//
# Use plt.hist() below
plt.hist(times, range=(0,24), bins=4)
  15. Use plt.show() to show the figure. Feel free to add a title, x-label, and y-label if you want. You can copy the code from the hint as an example.
//
# Use plt.hist() below
plt.hist(times, range=(0,24), bins=4)
plt.show()

                                        FINDING YOUR BEST BIN SIZE
GIVEN:
# Import packages
import codecademylib
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
# Read in transactions data
transactions = pd.read_csv("transactions.csv")
# Save transaction times to a separate numpy array
times = transactions["Transaction Time"].values
# Use plt.hist() below
plt.hist(times, range=(0, 24), bins=4,  edgecolor="black")
plt.title("Weekday Frequency of Customers")
plt.xlabel("Hours (1 hour increments)")
plt.ylabel("Count")
plt.show()
  16. Change the number of bins in your code from 4 to 24. What do you notice about the data? Given this new graph, when would you recommend staffing the grocery store? Check the 
hint to see what we thought.
//
...
plt.hist(times, range=(0, 24), bins=24,  edgecolor="black")
...

                                        REVIEW
  17. Now, the store manager wants a histogram of transaction costs. Try plotting a histogram for the cost variable. Some things to think about:
What is a reasonable minimum for transaction data? Maybe 0 dollars.
What is a reasonable maximum for the transaction data? Using np.amax(cost), we get 161.4. So, you could make the maximum 165.
How many bins should you use to adequately represent the data? Do some guess and check work to figure this out.
Finally, think about how this data could be useful to the store manager.
//
plt.hist(cost, range=(0,np.amax(cost)), bins=6)
plt.show() 
OR
plt.hist(cost, range=(0,np.amax(cost)), bins=16)
plt.show()
OR
plt.hist(cost, range=(0,np.amax(cost)), bins=36)
plt.show()
...
